# Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm

## Description
This project implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm in C++. The algorithm allows a secret to be divided into multiple parts (shares) such that only a subset of those parts is needed to reconstruct the original secret. This implementation showcases polynomial interpolation and secure sharing of secrets.

## Features
- Decodes y-values from various numeric bases.
- Computes the constant term of a polynomial using Lagrange interpolation.
- Identifies and reports "wrong" points that do not lie on the polynomial curve.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
